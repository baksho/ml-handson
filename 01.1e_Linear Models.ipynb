    "The logistic regression is implemented in [`LogisticRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression). Despite its name, it is implemented as a linear model for classification rather than regression in terms of the scikit-learn/ML nomenclature. The logistic regression is also known in the literature as logit regression, maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt) or the log-linear classifier. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function).\n",
