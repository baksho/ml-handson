This repository has basic concepts on different **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learnng** algorithms explained along with lots of code snippets for ease of understanding. The repository also contains lot of working examples of these algorithms for hands-on practice. The datasets used in the repository are provided.

The [User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) from **scikit-learn** has been heavily referenced (for the content and structuring the repository as well) along with some other resources which are mentioned below.

The conceptual theories are uploaded in the main folder as Jupyter notebooks. While the supporting hands-on examples referred in the theory sections are uploaded in [Examples](https://github.com/baksho/ml-handson/tree/main/Examples) folder; both Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and Python file (`.py`) are uploaded for all examples.
