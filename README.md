This repository has basic concepts on different **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learnng** algorithms explained along with lots of code snippets for ease of understanding. The repository also contains lot of working examples of these algorithms for hands-on practice. The datasets used in the repository are provided.
<br>The [User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) from **scikit-learn** has been heavily referenced (for the content and structuring the repository as well) along with some other resources which are mentioned below.
